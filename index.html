    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Jacob (Jake) Bryon. I am currently a fourth year physics major at UC Berkeley. I am
        interested in pursuing a doctoral degree in electrical engineering, focusing in physical devices. I have
        over two and a half years of experimental condensed matter physics research experience at Berkeley, as well as
        nuclear particle physics research experience at UCLA.

     </p>
     <h2>Bio</h2>
     <p>
        I was born in Annapolis Maryland and moved to Wilmington North Carolina when I was 4 years old.
        Since I was about 11 years old, I have desired to study the physical world around us. While in High School,
        I was dilligent in academics, extra curriculars and more, not only achieving a 4.0 GPA taking the hardest classes my school
        had to offer, but as well preforming in over a dozen theatrical and choral productions, wining both acting
        and directing awards for my efforts, and worked a part time job since the age of 16. I left North Carolina
        to pursue a degree in physics from the University of California at Berkeley, where I currently have a 3.6 GPA
        and plan to graduate with honors. During my time at Berkeley, I have consistently worked at least one part-time
        job, but most semesters I have worked two or more. However, my life is not all work. I also love to travel,
        having visited three continents and over a dozen countries, as well as exploring and hiking with friends.

    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <h2>Research and Course Based</h2>
    <h3>Condensed Matter Physics</h3>
      <p>
        In doing research for over two years, I have completed many projects. Some
        of these projects include using vapor transport to successfuly synthesize
        crystals of niobium diselendide and niobium triselenide, desgin and construction
        of high vacuum systems, restoration and regeneration of a glove box,
        desgin and creation of multiple electrical probes, cryostate operation for
        electrical transport measurements. As well I have listed bellow examples
        of my research posters, with their titles and links to the posters.
      </p>

        <li><a href = "files/Poster3.pdf" target= "_blank">
          Strain for Sliding Charge Density Wave in Quasi-Two Dimensional Materials</a></li>

          Wave and Superconductivity in van der Waals Heterostructures</a></li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Nuclear Particle Physics</h3>
      <p>
        My research was focused on a single project which utilized the AMPT model
        to preform a background simulation of Au+Au collisions. We published a
        paper on the work, <a href = "files/eventshape.pdf" target= "_blank">
        Event-shape-engineering study of charge separation in heavy-ion collisions</a>.
        The abstract for this paper can be found below.
        As well a poster was made and presented for my research, a copy of which
        can be found below.

      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href = "files/Poster4.pdf" target= "_blank">
          Search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect in Heavy-Ion Collisions and
          Quantification of the Background with the AMPT Model</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Abstract: Recent measurements of charge-dependent azimuthal correlations
        in high-energy heavy-ion collisions have indicated charge-separation
        signals perpendicular to the reaction plane, and have been related to the
        chiral magnetic effect (CME). However, the correlation signal is contaminated
        with the background caused by the collective motion (flow) of the collision system,
        and an effective approach is needed to remove the flow background from the correlation.
        We present a method study with simplified Monte Carlo simulations and a
        multi-phase transport model, and develop a scheme to reveal the true CME
        signal via the event-shape engineering with the flow vector of the particles
        of interest.
      </p>

    <h3>Audio Modulated Laser</h3>
      <p>
        In a lab based class at Berkeley I, with my lab partner Bobby Ge, designed and created
        an audio modulated laser. Effectively, we transmited audio signals through a
        laser beam. This device took input audio signals and modulated a laser with
        the signal, then when shown onto a photo-transistor the signal would play into
        the circuit and the output could be played through a speaker. A full write up and
        report of the project can be found <a href = "files/finalproject.pdf" target= "_blank">here.</a>
        As well, bellow is an audio player that contains two example recordings that
        we transmited with the laser.

      <h3>Machining/Metal Work</h3>
        <p>
          For my condensed matter physics research at Berkeley, I have designed
          and machined many different tools and devices for experiments. In order
          to keep lab designs private, I will not post them here. However, for
          my machining certification training to show mastery of the lathe and mill,
          I made the following small hammer using aluminum for the handle and stainless
          steel for the head.

    <h2>Personal</h2>
    <h3>Video Game Developement</h3>
    <p>
      Together with <a href = http://andrewhalle.com/ target= "_blank">Andrew Halle</a>,
      we have begun developement of our own gaming
      website. We develope games using Javascript and the rendering engine PIXI.
      Our site is <a href = http://twonerdsgames.com/ target = "_blank">Two Nerds Games</a>
      and will gain more games as time goes on. Currently we have created our first
      game <a href = http://twonerdsgames.com/lunargolf/ target = "_blank">Lunar Golf</a>
      and it is live via the pervious link. The web version of the game contains
      3 course with 9 levels per course. We are also in the process of developing
      a mobile app of Lunar Golf for IOS.
    </p>
    <h3>Web Design</h3>
    <p>
      This website is also a personal project of mine! This website was made
      with alot of work and research into using HTML and CSS. Also learning
      how to host using AWS and the in's and out's of building websites. I had
      help from the previous mentioned Andrew Halle in accomplishing all this.
