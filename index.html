    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Jacob (Jake) Bryon. I am currently a fourth year physics major at UC Berkeley. I am
        interested in pursuing a doctoral degree in electrical engineering, focusing in physical devices. I have
        over three years of experimental condensed matter physics research experience at Berkeley, as well have
        nuclear particle physics research experience at UCLA.

     </p>
     <h2>Bio</h2>
     <p>
        I was born in Annapolis Maryland, moving to Wilmington North Carolina when I was about 5 years old.
        Since I was about 11 years old, I have desired to study the physical world around us. While in High School,
        I diligently did my best in all avenues, not only achieving a 4.0 GPA taking the hardest classes my school
        had to offer, but as well preforming in over a dozen theatrical and choral productions, wining both acting
        and directing awards for my efforts, and worked a part time job since the age of 16. I left North Carolina
        to pursue a degree in physics from the University of California at Berkeley, where I currently have a 3.6 GPA
        and plan to graduate with honors. During my time at Berkeley, I have consistently worked at least one part-time
        job, but most semesters I have worked two or more. However, my life is not all work, I also love to travel,
        having visited three continents and over a dozen countries, as well as exploring and hiking with friends.

    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <h2>Research and Course Based</h2>
    <h3>Condensed Matter Physics</h3>
      <p>
        In doing research for over 3 years, I have completed many projects. Some
        of these projects include using vapor transport to successfuly synthesize
        crystals of niobium diselendide and niobium triselenide, desgin and construction
        of high vacuum systems, restoration and regeneration of a glove box,
        desgin and creation of multiple electrical probes, cryostate operation for
        electrical transport measurements. As well I have listed bellow examples
        of my research posters, with their titles and links to the posters.

      </ul>
    <h3>Nuclear Particle Physics</h3>
      <p>
        My research was focused on a single project which utilized the AMPT model
        to preform a background simulation of Au+Au collisions. A poster for the
        work is going to be presented and after that time, it will be loaded here.
        Until then, bellow is a detailed abstract of the work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) arises from the chirality imbalance of quarks and its
        interaction to the strong magnetic field generated in non-central heavy-ion collisions. Possible
        formation of domains of quarks with chirality imbalances is an intrinsic property of the Quantum
        ChromoDynamics (QCD), which describes the fundamental strong interactions among quarks
        and gluons. Azimuthal-angle correlations have been used to measure the magnitude of charge-
        separation across the reaction plane, which was predicted to arise from the CME [1]. However,
        backgrounds from collective motion (flow) of the collision system can also contribute to the
        correlation observable. In this poster, we investigate the magnitude of the background utilizing
        the AMPT model [2], which contains no CME signals. We demonstrate, for Au+Au collisions at
        200 and 39 GeV, a scheme to remove the flow background via the event-shape engineering with
        the vanishing magnitude of the flow vector. We also calculate the ensemble average of the
        charge-separation observable, and provide a background baseline for the experimental data.

    <h3>Audio Modulated Laser</h3>
      <p>
        In a lab based class at Berkeley I, with my lab partner Bobby Ge, designed and created
        an audio modulated laser. Effectively, we transmited audio signals through a
        laser beam. This device took input audio signals and modulated a laser with
        the signal, then when shown onto a photo-transistor the signal would play into
        the circuit and the output could be played through a speaker. A full write up and
        report of the project can be found <a href = "files/finalproject.pdf" target= "_blank">here.</a>
        As well, bellow is an audio player that contains two example recordings that
        we transmited with the laser.

    <h2>Personal</h2>
    <h3>Video Game Developement</h3>
    <p>
      Together with Andrew Halle, we have begun developement of our own gaming
      website. We develope games using Javascript and the rendering engine PIXI.
      Our site is <a href = http://twonerdsgames.com/ target = "_blank">Two Nerds Games</a>
      and will gain more games as time goes on. Currently we have created our first
      game <a href = http://twonerdsgames.com/lunargolf/ target = "_blank">Lunar Golf</a>
      and it is live via the pervious link. The web version of the game contains
      3 course with 9 levels per course. We are also in the process of developing
      a mobile app of Lunar Golf for IOS.
    </p>
    <h3>Web Design</h3>
    <p>
      This website is also a personal project of mine! This website was made
      with alot of work and research into using HTML and CSS. As well I had
      help from the previous mentioned Andrew Halle in the layout of this site.
